DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

File List: For this DATASET, there is only one associated file, in csv. format, called "Parkinson_disease-Group_gait_data". It contains information on clinical and demographic characteristics of 63 healthy older adults who participated in the experiments, as well as step and stride variables provided by gait analysis of these individuals. 

Are there multiple versions of the dataset? No.


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

***Purpose of the test campaign***
The aim of these experiments was to compare spatiotemporal gait parameters between people with PD and neurologically healthy peers from a significant number of participants.

***Intervention procedures***
The data collection protocol, which was performed in a single session, included an interview to collect clinical data, medication and disease diagnosis, as well as gait assessments. Participants walked three times on an unobstructed path (8.5 x 1.5 m) at a self-selected pace, while using markers for three-dimensional gait collection. Gait parameters were acquired using 10 Vicon Motion Systems® cameras (100 Hz). The acquired data were filtered using a 5th order low-pass digital Butterworth filter (zero-lag) with a cutoff frequency of 6 Hz.
